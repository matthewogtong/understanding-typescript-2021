# Session 2

## Core Types

* number 
    * 1, 5.3, -10 
    * All numbers, no differentation between integers or floats

* string
    * 'Hi', "Hi", `Hi`
    * All text values

* boolean
    * true, false
    * Just these two, no "truthy" or "falsy" values

## Key Points

* JavaScript uses "dynamic types" (resolved at runtime), TypeScript uses "static types" (set during development).

* Having errors thrown during development instead of runtime is a huge advantage in spotting bugs early

* Core Primitive Types in TypeScript are all lowercase.

## Miscellaneous Notes

* In JavaScript and TypeScript, all numbers are floats by default.
    * No difference between 5 || 5.0

* TypeScript has a built-in feature named Type Inference 
    * Infers which type you have in a variable or constant

* Core task of TypeScript is to check types and yell at us if we're using it incorrectly
